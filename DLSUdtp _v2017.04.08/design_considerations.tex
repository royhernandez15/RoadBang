Before starting the first section, provide an overview of the purpose of this chapter and its contents, and how they are relevant to your methodology. 

Your primary goal in the Design Considerations chapter is to describe to your panelist/readers the key topics that fall further under Theoretical Considerations, but should be placed here instead since they are geared towards your Methodology. These key topics are those that you have directly adopted in making your solution/methodology.  You can think of the connection of the Design Considerations chapter to the Theoretical Considerations chapter in this way: if your Theoretical Considerations chapter serves as the main foundation of a building, then the Design Considerations chapter functions as the columns. 

The  Design Considerations chapter is an avenue for explaining why you considered the topics here for your proposed methodology. This chapter is different from your methodology, because topics you discuss here are already accepted as part of the body of knowledge, and may have not been developed by you.
