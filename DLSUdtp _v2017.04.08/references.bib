 Control},
  Abstract                 = {The steady state performance of a bulk transfer TCP flow
 (i.e. a flow with a large amount of data to send, such as FTP
 transfers) may be characterized by three quantities. The first
 is the send rate, which is the amount of data sent by the
 sender in unit time. The second is the throughput, which is
 the amount of data received by the receiver in unit time. Note
 that the throughput will always be less than or equal to the
 send rate due to losses. Finally, the number of non-duplicate
 packets received by the receiver in unit time gives us the
 goodput of the connection. The goodput is always less than or
 equal to the throughput, since the receiver may receive two
 copies of the same packet due to retransmissions by the
 sender. In a previous paper, we presented a simple model for
 predicting the steady state send rate of a bulk transfer TCP
 flow as a function of loss rate and round trip time. In this
 paper, we extend that work in two ways. First, we analyze the
 performance of bulk transfer TCP flows using more precise,
 stochastic analysis. Second, we build upon the previous
 analysis to provide both an approximate formula as well as a
 more accurate stochastic model for the steady state throughput
 of a bulk transfer TCP flow.},

 methods are suggested to avoid the arbitrariness in the
 point-selection schemes and van der Waals exclusion radii:
 CHELP-BOW, which also estimates the charges from the
 electrostatic potential, but with potential points that are
 Boltzmann-weighted after their occurrence in actual
 simulations using the energy function of the program in which
 the charges will be used, and CHELMO, which estimates the
 charges directly from the electrostatic multipole
 moments. Different criteria for the quality of the charges are
 discussed.},
