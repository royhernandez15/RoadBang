Constants are also set in regular font like $\mathrm{j}$.  Functions are also set in regular font, e.g. in $\sin \left( \cdot \right)$.  Commonly used notations are $t$, $f$, $\mathrm{j} = \sqrt{-1}$, $n$ and $\exp \left( \cdot \right)$, which refer to the time variable, frequency variable, imaginary unit, $n$th variable, and exponential function, respectively.
